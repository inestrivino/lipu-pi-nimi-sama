## What can the website do

The website has various features:

- **Change the display language between the available options** (currently: English, Spanish, French and Toki Pona)
- **Change the theme** (dark or light)
- **Insert a word to find rhyming Toki Pona words**
- **Choose what type of rhymes you want** (vowel vs full, number of rhyming syllables)
- **Add new words to the list of words**. This will allow your own personal words to be shown as rhyming words.

These features are geared towards giving users the possibility of adapting the website to their own needs and Toki Pona use.
\
The minimalistic design of the website was purposefully chosen to fit the philosophy of Toki Pona.

Here is a look at what the website looks like:
